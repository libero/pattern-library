          The origin of angiosperms has been a long-standing botanical debate. The great diversity of angiosperms in the
          Early Cretaceous makes the Jurassic a promising period in which to anticipate the origins of the angiosperms.
          Here, based on observations of 264 specimens of 198 individual flowers preserved on 34 slabs in various states
          and orientations, from the South Xiangshan Formation (Early Jurassic) of China, we describe a fossil flower,

          gen. et sp. nov.. The large number of specimens and various preservations allow for an evidence-based
          reconstruction of the flower. From the evidence of the combination of an invaginated receptacle and ovarian
          roof, we infer that the seeds of

          were completely enclosed. Evidence of an actinomorphic flower with a dendroid style, cup-form receptacle, and
          angiospermy, is consistent with

          being a bona fide angiosperm from the Jurassic, an inference that we hope will re-invigorate research into
          angiosperm origins.

        From oranges to apples, flowering plants produce most of the fruits and vegetables that we can see on display in
        a supermarket. While we may take little notice of the poppy fields and plum blossoms around us, how flowers came
        to be has been an intensely debated mystery.

        The current understanding, which is mainly based on previously available fossils, is that flowers appeared about
        125 million years ago in the Cretaceous, an era during which many insects such as bees also emerged. But not
        everybody agrees that this is the case. Genetic analyses, for example, suggest that flowering plants are much
        more ancient. Another intriguing element is that flowers seemed to have arisen during the Cretaceous ‘out of
        nowhere’.

        Fossils are essential to help settle the debate but it takes diligence and luck to find something as fragile as
        a flower preserved in rocks for millions of years. In addition, digging out what could look like a bloom is not
        enough. It is only if the ovules (the cells that will become seeds when fertilized) of the plant are completely
        enclosed inside the ovary before pollination that researchers can definitely say that they have found a ‘true’
        flower.

          Now, Fu et al. describe over 200 specimens of a new fossil flower that presents this characteristic, as well
          as other distinctive features such as petals and sepals – the leaf-like parts that protect a flower bud.

          , the plant dates back to more than 174 million years ago, making it the oldest known record of a ‘true’
          flower by almost 50 million years. Contrary to mainstream belief, this would place the apparition of flowering
          plants to the Early Jurassic, the period that saw dinosaurs dominating the planet. This discovery may reshape
          our current understanding of the evolution of flowers.
