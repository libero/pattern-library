                The origin of angiosperms has been a long-standing botanical debate. The great diversity of angiosperms
                in the Early Cretaceous makes the Jurassic a promising period in which to anticipate the origins of the
                angiosperms. Here, based on observations of 264 specimens of 198 individual flowers preserved on 34
                slabs in various states and orientations, from the South Xiangshan Formation (Early Jurassic) of China,
                we describe a fossil flower,

                gen. et sp. nov.. The large number of specimens and various preservations allow for an evidence-based
                reconstruction of the flower. From the evidence of the combination of an invaginated receptacle and
                ovarian roof, we infer that the seeds of

                were completely enclosed. Evidence of an actinomorphic flower with a dendroid style, cup-form
                receptacle, and angiospermy, is consistent with

                being a bona fide angiosperm from the Jurassic, an inference that we hope will re-invigorate research
                into angiosperm origins.

              The current understanding, which is mainly based on previously available fossils, is that flowers appeared
              about 125 million years ago in the Cretaceous, an era during which many insects such as bees also emerged.
              But not everybody agrees that this is the case. Genetic analyses, for example, suggest that flowering
              plants are much more ancient. Another intriguing element is that flowers seemed to have arisen during the
              Cretaceous ‘out of nowhere’.

              Fossils are essential to help settle the debate but it takes diligence and luck to find something as
              fragile as a flower preserved in rocks for millions of years. In addition, digging out what could look
              like a bloom is not enough. It is only if the ovules (the cells that will become seeds when fertilized) of
              the plant are completely enclosed inside the ovary before pollination that researchers can definitely say
              that they have found a ‘true’ flower.

                Now, Fu et al. describe over 200 specimens of a new fossil flower that presents this characteristic, as
                well as other distinctive features such as petals and sepals – the leaf-like parts that protect a flower
                bud. Called

                , the plant dates back to more than 174 million years ago, making it the oldest known record of a ‘true’
                flower by almost 50 million years. Contrary to mainstream belief, this would place the apparition of
                flowering plants to the Early Jurassic, the period that saw dinosaurs dominating the planet. This
                discovery may reshape our current understanding of the evolution of flowers.
