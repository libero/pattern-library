 This is needed to force selector order in some situations where a fallback has higher specificity than the code it's
 providing fallback for (e.g. when using the dir attribute selector to fallback from padding-inline in the padding mixin).
 Sass will put these higher specificity selectors after the code they are providing fallbacks for, which is not what we
 want. Introducing this selector on the non-fallback increases the specificity of the authored code so it occurs after
 the fallbacks. The minor increase in specificity is unavoidable, but this seems an acceptable trade off.
