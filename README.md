Libero pattern library
======================

## Developing with the pattern library
Developer quick start: running `./bin/dev` will set up the pattern environment, run gulp and start the pattern library web server.  

## Pipeline

The build process uses a Node.js container image to build all assets, and copy them out of the container into `export/`.

`export/` can then be packaged to be released on Github, or reused elsewhere.
